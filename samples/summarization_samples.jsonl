{"text": "Tropical Storm Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone that made landfall as a tropical depression in the Mexican state of Michoacán on October 23, 2018, causing deadly mudslides. The 21st named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Vicente originated from a tropical wave that departed from Africa's western coast on October 6. The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17. The disturbance became better defined over the next couple of days, forming into a tropical depression early on October 19. Located in an environment favorable for further development, the system organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day.\nThe small cyclone traveled northwestward along the Guatemalan coast before later shifting to a more westerly track. Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,002 mbar (29.59 inHg). At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic eye feature in its central dense overcast. The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest. Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21. A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen. However, outflow from the nearby Hurricane Willa caused Vicente to weaken into a tropical depression early on October 23. After making landfall near Playa Azul at 13:30 UTC, Vicente quickly lost organization and dissipated a few hours later.\nVicente caused torrential rainfall in the Mexican states of Michoacán, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Guerrero, and Colima; the highest total exceeded 12 in (300 mm) in Oaxaca. In some states, the effects of Vicente compounded those from the nearby Hurricane Willa. The storm left a total of 16 people dead throughout 2 states: 13 in Oaxaca and 3 in Veracruz. The heavy rainfall caused numerous rivers to spill their banks, dozens of landslides to occur, and severe flooding to ensue elsewhere. This resulted in hundreds of homes being inundated, dozens of road closures, and agricultural damage amongst an array of other effects. Plan DN-III-E was activated in multiple states to provide aid to affected individuals. The federal and state governments mobilized to help with relief efforts and repairs."}
{"text": "人形峠は、鳥取県中央部の倉吉平野と岡山県の津山盆地をつなぐ峠である。峠の頂上は中国山地の人形仙と、その東側にある伯州山の間に連なる稜線の鞍部にあり、四等三角点の「人形峠」（標高740.20メートル）が置かれている[5]。\n峠の西側（鳥取県側）は天神川本流の上流部の支川である加谷川の源流が迫り、急峻である。一方、東側（岡山県側）には吉井川水系の池河川があり、標高700～850メートルにかけて緩やかな高清水高原を形成している。この高原には日本原子力研究開発機構の人形峠環境技術センターの敷地が広がっている。周辺ではかつて天然ウランの採掘や精錬が行われていた[3]。\n峠を抜ける国道179号（津山街道）は、もとは県道として整備された道で、1899年（明治32年）に開通した。当時はトンネルではなく、実際に峠越えが行われていた。現在の人形トンネルは1981年（昭和56年）に開通した。人形トンネル開通以前は「打札越」（異名四ツ筋[6]）と呼ばれていた。\n人形峠付近では、春にはたくさんのヤマボウシがみられ、夏はキャンプ、秋は紅葉狩り、冬は温泉やスキーなどでにぎわう[7]。"}
{"text": "The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station (Ukrainian: Кахо́вська ГЕС імені П. С. Непорожнього; commonly the Kakhovka Dam) was a run-of-river power plant from 1955 until 2023 on the Dnieper River in Nova Kakhovka, Ukraine. Nova Kakhovka is a port city located on the reservoir's southern bank. The primary purposes of the dam were hydroelectric power generation, irrigation and navigation. It was the 6th and the last dam in the Dnieper reservoir cascade.\nThe deep water channel created by the downstream flow allowed shipping up and down river.[1] The facility also included a winter garden. The P47 road and a railway crossed the Dnieper River on the dam.[2]\nThe Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant had 241 staff in October 2015. The director is Yaroslav Kobelya from September 2012. As of 2019, the dam was profitable bringing ₴6.1 million ($236,000) to local government budgets and ₴44.6 million ($1.73 million) to the national income.[1]\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on the morning of 6 June 2023, a significant portion of the dam was destroyed, possibly by an explosion near the dam's center, releasing a large amount of water downstream.[3][4]"}
